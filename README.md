# OxMood
Ever wondered how Oxford is feeling? We have made an ML model which tracks the sentiment of Oxfess, the university confession page, and plotted it over the last 6 months. Does 5th Week Blues exist? <br/>
See 'confessions.txt' for the scraped Facebook data of confessions.<br/>
See 'Web Scraping' for the code.<br/>
See 'Sentiment Analysis' for the machine learning sentiment analysis classification algorythm.
